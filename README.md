## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- My motivation in creating this project lies within my curiousity in dissecting the code that creates functionality to each URL and webpage
- I created this project to take the first step in directing my curiousity on the subject towards knowledge on the subject
- Creating this functioning webpage solves and explores the core functions (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that allow such a webpage to be possible.
- I learned the functionality of git, VS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and beyond that learned the necessary commands and lines of code to make each program/script function properly. 

## Installation

Project development and installation was not possible without VS (Visual Studio Code), Git Bash, and Git Hub. All three programs were used in simulataneous fashion. Git Bash and Git Hub were used to create the base of this project, while VS was used to flesh out the coding and fundamentals of the project so that it could look and turn out the way it did. Git Hub will be used for the deployment of this project as well.

## Features

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute to it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
